Projects for ECE course Computational Intelligence
## Project 1
Build a Fuzzy PI Controller with the following specifications on MATLAB Simulink:
Markup: * Rejection of disorders. For cyclic disturbance frequency less than 1 rad/sec there should be disturbance gain at most 20 dB. In addition, if there is a change in the TL, we want the Ï‰ to change temporarily and then return (with good approach) to the value it had before the disturbance.
* Maximum 5% elevation for step input.
* Zero position error e<sub>ss</sub
* Rise time maximum of 160 msec
* V<sub>a</sub> &le 200V for each t &gt 0.
## Project 2
Solve a regression problem using TSK models. Fuzzy Neural Networks on MATLAB with datasets from UCI repository and feature selection with cross validation technichs were used.

## Project 3
Solve a classification problem using Mulit-Layer Perceptron Network. Tensorflow and keras on Python with MNIST dataset (handwritten digit images of 28x28 pixels each) was used, the goal was to correctly rank each image in the class corresponding to the digit it represents. (Jupyter Notebook also used)

## Project 4
Solve o regression problem using RBF Network. Tensorflow and keras on Python with Boston housing dataset was used, the goal was predicting the price value of each real estate on Boston area. (Jupyter Notebook also used)
